Find out more by reading:
Presentation slides at http://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.1054651

Test forms for humans are available at http://fml.data.ac.nz/ and http://fml.adamfield.net/
Actual endpoints hosted at http://fml.data.ac.nz/fillmylist and http://fml.adamfield.net/fillmylist

(These are hosted on personal servers and might not last forever - we're still looking for a permanent home for an FML service.)

Try out the forms to see which parameters the webservice endpoints accept and require.

Demonstration repositories are available for testing, too:

- http://demoprints.eprints.org : Self-register at this demo EPrints site and try out the autocomplete person name lookups when entering author information in a submission form

- http://fml.data.ac.nz/xmlui : Self-register at this demo DSpace site and try out person name authority lookups and equipment authority lookups. Note: this particular instance will only stay up for as long as Kim can afford it. Generic authority lookups will be contribued to DSpace core shortly, at which time http://demo.dspace.org should work for person name lookup demos
